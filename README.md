This page for IT consulting company website simulation. It aims to present two data cases from the first perspective of FoxData.

This project is split into two cases:
* The first case aims to implement supervise model to detect fraud transactions. 
* The second case focus on data processing and visualizations.

Both cases are visualized by D3, Plotly, and Matplotlib.

## Nootbook
For details of data processing and methodologies. Please visit the shared Google Colab Notebooks:

## Dependencies
* Python 2.7/3.7
* Visual Stiduo Code
* imblearn 0.5.0+
* sklearn
* D3

## Motivation
The project is an exercise in challenging full-stack positions. Aimed at completing a series of comprehensive qualities including data preprocessing, modeling, visualization, front-end design and so on in a short time. The total time was 15 hours.

## Future Improvement
* Try more machine learning models and manually tune to get the optimal solution.
* Optimize the problem of too long single page length for better user interaction.
* Embed model allows the user to directly play with new inputs. Make the webpage have the function of real-time calculation and feedback.
